Typical DBA will work with many databases, residing on both, local and remote
sites, running different [major versions of PostgreSQL][1]. Daily activities
will require connecting to the databases for ad-hoc actions or scheduling
automation scripts. As number of targets grows, it becomes a noticable
overhead to maintain all of them, especially tracking upgrades and security
changes.
